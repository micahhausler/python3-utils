-----------------
To get all the development libraries, run::

    $ git clone git://github.com/micahhausler/python3-utils.git
    $ cd python3-utils
    $ virtualenv env
    $ . env/bin/activate

To get the source source code and run the unit tests, run::

    $ pip install -e .[test]
    $ python setup.py install
    $ python setup.py nosetests

While 100% code coverage does not make a library bug-free, it significantly
reduces the number of easily caught bugs! Please make sure coverage is at 100%
before submitting a pull request!

Code Quality
------------

For code quality, please run flake8::

    $ pip install -e .[test]
    $ flake8 .

Code Styling

    # Third party package imports
    from mock import patch

    # Local package imports
    from python3_utils.version import __version__

Please follow `Google's python style`_ guide wherever possible.
